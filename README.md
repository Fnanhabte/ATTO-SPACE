<p>ATTO SPACE is a login form system used on the front end of a website, web app, or mobile app to collect information needed to verify whether a user has been registered in a system‚Äôs database.</p> 

<p>The authentication process is simple. First, the user submits some credentials ‚Äî typically an email and password ‚Äî to the backend through a login form. Then, the backend application checks if the email and password are in the database. From there, the backend app will either grant users access or require them to register.</p>
<p>Now that you have an overview of the project, let‚Äôs start building! </p>
